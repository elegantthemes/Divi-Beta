## Divi 5.0 Release Phases

## Current Divi 5.0 Release Phase - Dev Alpha (5.0.0-dev-alpha.x)
This is an unfinished version of the Divi 5.0 API. It will give developers a glimpse into the future of Divi so that they can start making plans on how their current Divi extensions will need to be adapted and provide an opportunity to share feedback on the new API, code examples, docs, express any API wants or needs and share their overall experience.

It's important to be clear that the API is not in a state that is considered stable or ready for developers to build production-ready extensions. It is a work in progress and will be subject to change as we move through the Dev Alpha Phase, especially as we hear feedback from developers.

Please use this Dev Alpha Phase to start planning for the future of your Divi extensions, including how you will adapt your current extensions to work with the new API, and share your feedback with us as you may have ideas that we haven't thought of yet or you may have a better way of doing something. We are all in this together and we want to make sure that the Divi 5.0 API is as good as it can be.

Please wait until the Dev Beta Phase to start building production-ready extensions using the new API.

## Reporting Feature Requests
In fact, when you update to Divi 5.0, you won’t notice much of a change from a UI perspective. We aren’t adding a bunch of new features in Divi 5.0. That’s not the goal. At first glance, the Divi Builder is going to look and function the same way that it does now (with maybe a few cool new things snuck in here and there), but everything behind the scenes is going to be vastly improved, and those improvements will manifest themselves in several significant ways.

With that said, were you hoping to see a specific feature in Divi 5.0? If so, please submit a [Feature Request issue here](https://github.com/elegantthemes/Divi-Beta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=IMPROVEMENT&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md&title=SCOPE+%3A%3A+Summary).

## Reporting Documentation Issues or Suggestions
If you run into any issues with the documentation or have any suggestions for improving it, please submit a [Documentation Request here](https://github.com/elegantthemes/Divi-Beta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=DOCS_REQUEST.md&title=SCOPE+%3A%3A+Summary).


## Reporting Bugs
If you run into any issues during testing, please submit a detailed [Bug Report issue here](https://github.com/elegantthemes/Divi-Beta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=BUG&template=BUG_REPORT.md&title=SCOPE+%3A%3A+Summary). We will do our best to address the issue as soon as possible and will keep you updated on the progress or any questions we may have.

## Before Submitting A Bug

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of the beta.

3. Make sure you have tested the issue on a clean install of the beta with no other plugins or themes active.

4. Make sure you have searched for similar issues before submitting a new one.

## Voting Up Feature Requests or Bugs 👍
If you would like to give your opinion on a feature request or bug, simply add the thumbs up emoji reaction to the corresponding issue. This helps us prioritize which features and bugs require our attention the most. We can't guarantee that every single feature or bug will be addressed depending solely on the number of thumbs up received; however, we'll do our best to focus on the aspects with the biggest impact first, basing our future [roadmap](https://devalpha.elegantthemes.com/roadmap) on the input given.

Please do not submit duplicate issues for the same feature request or bug. If you would like to add additional information to an existing issue, please add a comment to the issue.
