# Welcome To the Divi Beta Program

This empty public repo is used to track bugs during Divi alpha/beta testing phases.

## Divi 5.0 Release Phases
You can read more about the Divi 5.0 annoucement here: https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/general-news/the-future-of-divi

You can read more about the Divi Release Phases here: https://devalpha.elegantthemes.com/docs/introducing-divi-5/divi-5-release-phases

## Current Divi 5.0 Release Phase - Public Alpha (5.0.0-public-alpha.x)
We will start the public alpha with a ‚Äúlite‚Äù version of Divi 5.0. This will be a fully-functional version of Divi 5.0, but it will be lacking some of Divi's current features and modules.

Do not use this in any production site. Please make backups prior to installing this or any alpha/beta application.

Developers can start adding support for Divi 5 for your extension or build a 
new extension for Divi 5.0, and can start testing your extension on Divi 5.0.

This is a great opportunity for developers to share feedback on the new API, code examples, 
docs, express any API wants or needs and share their overall experience.


## Developer Documentation
Developer documentation for Divi 5.0 can be found here: https://devalpha.elegantthemes.com/

## Divi 5.0 Roadmap
With the Divi 5.0 Roadmap, you will see what features are completed, what is in progress, and which are planned for each release phase. Please note that this roadmap is subject to change at any time.

## Have a question?

## Reporting Feature Requests
We aren‚Äôt adding a bunch of new features in Divi 5.0. That‚Äôs not the goal. The Divi Builder has received an [enhanced design](https://devalpha.elegantthemes.com/blog/release-dev-beta-9#enhanced-design) but will largely function the same way that it does now (with maybe a few cool new things snuck in here and there), but everything behind the scenes is going to be vastly improved, and those improvements will manifest themselves in several significant ways.

With that said, were you hoping to see a specific feature in Divi 5.0? If so, please submit a [Feature Request issue here](https://github.com/elegantthemes/Divi-Beta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=IMPROVEMENT&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md&title=SCOPE+%3A%3A+Summary).

## Reporting Documentation Issues or Suggestions
If you run into any issues with the documentation or have any suggestions for improving it, please submit a [Documentation Request here](https://github.com/elegantthemes/Divi-Beta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=DOCS_REQUEST.md&title=SCOPE+%3A%3A+Summary).


## Reporting Bugs

We will do our best to address the issue as soon as possible and will keep you updated on the progress or any questions we may have.

## Voting Up Feature Requests or Bugs üëç
If you would like to give your opinion on a feature request or bug, simply add the thumbs up emoji reaction to the corresponding issue. This helps us prioritize which features and bugs require our attention the most. We can't guarantee that every single feature or bug will be addressed depending solely on the number of thumbs up received; however, we'll do our best to focus on the aspects with the biggest impact first, basing our future [roadmap](https://devalpha.elegantthemes.com/roadmap) on the input given.

Please do not submit duplicate issues for the same feature request or bug. If you would like to add additional information to an existing issue, please add a comment to the issue.
